## What if you could just... talk to Claude?

Imagine explaining a bug out loud and hearing Claude walk you through the fix. Or having a back-and-forth design discussion while you code. Voice Mode makes Claude Code feel like pair programming with a real person.

**In 30 seconds:** Install Voice Mode and say "Hey Claude, let's debug this together" - and actually have a conversation.

## Why Voice Mode Changes Everything

### Before Voice Mode 😔
- Type long explanations of bugs
- Copy-paste error messages back and forth
- Lose context switching between docs and code
- Feel isolated debugging alone
- Wait for responses without knowing if Claude understood

### After Voice Mode 🚀
- "Claude, this function is throwing an error" *paste* "What's wrong?"
- "Walk me through this architecture while I look at the code"
- "Let's brainstorm a better approach" (actual back-and-forth!)
- Feels like pair programming with a senior developer
- Natural conversation flow - Claude waits for your response

## What Users Say
